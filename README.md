## Description

I am Savo Kos, Front-End Web Developer based in Bosnia.
My story as a Front-End Web Developer started 4 years ago in high school. The first time I came across HTML and CSS, I fell in love. That was when I was 16, and I started learning from then on.

Now, I can say that I am an experienced Front-End Web Developer and Designer with four years of experience. I am a Self-taught Developer and student. I do not have a job at the moment, but I am trying to build a freelance career. And I know I will succeed because this is the thing I am really passionate about.

If you have a business proposal, question, or offer, you can contact me by e-mail or using the contact form at the end of the page. If you need a website, you can visit my Upwork and hire me.
