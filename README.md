# Welcome to my personal portfolio!<br>
I am Savo Kos, Frond-End Developer based in Bosnia. <br />
              My story as a Frond-End Developer started 4 years ago in high
              school. The first time I came across HTML and CSS, I fell in love.
              That was when I was 16, and I started learning from then on.
              <br /><br />
              Now, I can say that I am an experienced Front-End Developer and
              Designer with four years of experience. I am a Self-taught
              Developer and student. I do not have a job at the moment, but I am
              trying to build a freelance career. And I know I will succeed
              because this is the thing I am really passionate about.
              <br /><br />
              Speaking of passion, I really like riding a bicycle. That is the
              only thing besides coding and tech I genuinely enjoy. Also, in
              free time I like to play games, watch movies, hang out with my
              friends and family.
              <br /><br />
