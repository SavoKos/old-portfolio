## Description

I am Savo Kos, Frond-End Developer based in Bosnia. <br /><br />
My story as a Frond-End Developer started 4 years ago in high
school. The first time I came across HTML and CSS, I fell in love.
That was when I was 16, and I started learning from then on.
<br /><br />
Now, I can say that I am an experienced Front-End Developer and
Designer with four years of experience. I am a Self-taught
Developer and student. I do not have a job at the moment, but I am
trying to build a freelance career. And I know I will succeed
because this is the thing I am really passionate about.
<br /><br />
If you have a business proposal, question, or offer, you can
contact me by e-mail or using the contact form in my portfolio.
